## Node API
This application is based on REST API build in node.js. API is deployed on heroku at https://evening-dusk-90900.herokuapp.com . To set up the node API move to the node_api directory and run the following command in terminal/command prompt:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the required dependencies for the API. To start the server run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
```
npm start
```
*The server will run on port 5000.*  
Alternatively API can also be fetched directly from heroku and using the respective routes. Link for route to test the [Root Path](https://evening-dusk-90900.herokuapp.com).
